rps.py is a Rock Paper Scissors game. Each iteration of the game increases in complexity. 

The iterations of the game are taken from Dave Gray's tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2EJuAcrZYU&amp;t=17794s


Game updates are as follows:

1 - A very basic version of the Rock Paper Scissors game. It plays once then exits.
 
2 - The same basic game, with the option to continue playing after each game.

3 - Game tracks and displays statistics: game count, player wins, computer wins, ties.

4 - User input handling is improved, game loops asking for correct input rather than exiting or crashing.

5 - Game is now the module rock_paper_scissors.

6 - Game takes the player's name as an argument and uses it to personalise the game play.
